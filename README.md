# Hypothesis-Testing

The project in R programming language involved the analysis of a crime dataset spanning from 2020 to the present. Here's a brief description of the steps involved:

1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - The dataset was cleaned to remove missing values and rows containing zeroes.
   - Rows with null values were also removed to ensure data integrity.
   - Blank spaces in the "Weapon Desc" column were replaced with "UNKNOWN WEAPON/OTHER" to standardize the data.

2. **Statistical Tests:**
   - Sample Proportion Test: Used to determine whether the proportion of a specific attribute in the dataset is significantly different from a hypothesized value.
   - 1 Sample Z Test: Assesses whether the mean of a sample is significantly different from a known population mean when the population standard deviation is known.
   - Z Test with 2 Samples: Compares the means of two independent samples to determine if they are significantly different from each other.
   - T Test with 2 Samples: Similar to the Z test with 2 samples but used when the population standard deviation is unknown or when the sample size is small.
   - Chi-Squared Goodness of Fit Test: Determines whether the observed frequency distribution of categorical data differs from a hypothesized distribution.
   - Chi-Squared Test of Independence: Assesses whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables in a contingency table.

3. **Analysis:**
   - Each statistical test was applied to the crime dataset to draw insights and inferential conclusions.
   - Results from these tests provided valuable information about the characteristics of the crime data and potential relationships between variables.
   - Findings were used to make informed decisions or recommendations in relevant contexts, such as law enforcement or public policy.

Overall, the project utilized statistical methods in R to analyze crime data, identify patterns, and draw meaningful conclusions to support decision-making processes.
